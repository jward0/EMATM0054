1. As the sensors (bumpers, line sensors) are located at the front of the robot, it makes sense to drive the robot
	in this direction as this gives us a) the ability to usefully use the bumpers and b) the ability to read
	from the line sensors before the centre of the robot is over the area they're reading, rather than after,
	which lets the robot react to the environment faster

2. The ball-caster may have been included to add to the stability of the robot, as two points of contact are
	fundamentally unstable, but if the robot can be made to rest on three it is stable. The ball-caster may be
	more suited at the rear as this allows the line sensors to be at the front of the robot without taking
	up the same space that is desirable for the ball-caster. A caster wheel can rotate freely around its z
	axis, at an offset in xy so it more easily rotates to follow motion. Ball-casters are cheaper and more
	mechanically simple, but less ideal for larger ground clearances as the ball required becomes large.

3. The left-most and right-most ground sensors may be useful to detect the direction of a sharp turn in a line
	being followed, or to detect lines near the robot in the event that it moves off the line.
