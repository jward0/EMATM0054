largest value (matte black surface): 3740uS
smallest value (gloss white surface): 650uS

largest value 11 bits to represent in binary, 32u4 has ADC resolution of 10 bits which would not be sufficient.

With IR LED turned off:
matte black surface gives 840000
gloss white surface gives 77500

This is based on whatever ambient IR can reflect off the surface beneath the robot
