1. Minimum forward value: 11
	Minimum reverse value: 11
	Same for forward and reverse
	In this case the same for both motors, but no reason why this should necessarily be true
	Battery level could affect this (can predict and test from a software battery monitor), though varying
	this will take a long time to allow battery level to drain. Other obvious factors are exact motor
	properties, which we cannot control and must instead just account for, the nature of the surface (ie. 
	texture, slope, etc. which can be controlled for after some testing to determine how behaviour varies)
	and weight of the robot, which we can control within a certain range (ie. we can add weight to the robot,
	but not really remove it). 
2.
	Positive drifts are to the right
	PWM value = 20:
	Drifts of 114mm, 125mm, 135mm, 125mm, 145mm, 135mm, 135mm, 130mm, 150mm, 140mm
	
	PWM value = 40:
	Drifts of 95mm, 50mm, 40mm, 60mm, 55mm, 45mm, 30mm, 45mm, 20mm, 30mm
